This project serves as the starting point for the SKA Digital Twin Pipeline, which is written in Python and set up in an interactive Jupyter Notebook environment. Two specific radio telescope packages are used:

- OSKAR: Responsible for the simulation of the sky and the telescope https://github.com/OxfordSKA/OSKAR
	- OSKAR telescope files telescope.tm are from https://github.com/OxfordSKA/OSKAR/releases -> Example Data
- RASCIL: Responsible for imaging https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/external/rascil
