channels:
  - i4ds
  - nvidia/label/cuda-11.7.0
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
# Set dependencies and it's constraints in the package they belong. Otherwise you just cause chaos for future builds.
# Just Karabo's direct dependencies and Karabo constraints (from our code) should be handled here.
# Dependencies with unstable APIs (this usually includes Karabo-Feedstock) should be fixed.
# Don't fix anything regarding build-string (except mpi) here. There's a lot you could do wrong.
#
# IMPORTANT: If you add or remove dependencies, make sure to adjust conda/meta.yaml as well.
