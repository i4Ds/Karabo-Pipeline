Telescope Configuration naming conventions:

Karabo supports many telescope configurations from various observations cycle. 
Karabo uses OSKAR telescope directory structure. The name of the directory is given the name of the telescope followed by configuration or cycle specification e.g. for VLA configuration C will be “vla.c.tm” and for ALMA cycle 4.2, the name is “alma.cycle4.2”. The  top-level directory must contain a special file to specify the telescope centre position (position.txt), a special file to specify the position of each station (layout.txt), and a set of sub-directories one for every station. Each of these sub-directories contains one or more special files to specify the configuration of that station. For telescope with dishes, it contain just a number.
