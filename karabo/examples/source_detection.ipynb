    "This notebook shows an end to end radio interferometry pipeline from the sky to final image using the Karabo pipeline. In addition, we show you how to get the pixel coordinates of the point sources of the produced image. The simulation of the sky, telescope and observation are based on [OSKAR](https://ska-telescope.gitlab.io/sim/oskar/), the imaging on [RASCIL](https://ska-telescope.gitlab.io/external/rascil/index.html).\n",

    "For this example we use the GLEAM survey [GLEAM EGC catalog version 2](https://vizier.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/VizieR-3), which can be downloaded from the [VizieR](https://cdsarc.unistra.fr/viz-bin/cat/VIII/100) service. To download the full survey, you have to change **preferences/max** to unlimited. The download here was done using the **FITS (binary) Table** option which can be selected in the dropdown menu below. The GLEAM survey was created using the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), the low-frequency Square Kilometre Array (SKA1 LOW) precursor located in western Australia. The catalogue covers 24,402 square degrees, over declinations south of +30° and galactic latitudes outside 10° of the galactic plane, excluding some areas such as the Magellanic clouds. It contains 307,456 radio sources with 20 separate flux density measurements across 72-231 MHz, selected from a time- and frequency- integrated image centred at 200 MHz, with a resolution of ~=2'."
