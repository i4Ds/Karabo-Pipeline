  Karabo is a radio astronomy software distribution for
  validation and benchmarking of radio telescopes and
  algorithms. It can be used to simulate the behavior of the
  Square Kilometer Array or other supported telescopes. Our
  goal is to make installation and ramp-up easier for
  researchers and developers.
  Karabo is written in Python, composed of modules
  that can be set up in an interactive Jupyter Notebook
  environment.
